# lowkey

Static marketing site for [lowkey.luxury](https://lowkey.luxury), an ideology expressed through objects and community.

## Development

The site is plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The entry point is `index.html` with assets in the repository root.

## Deployment

This repository is designed for GitHub Pages using a custom domain.

- `CNAME` specifies `lowkey.luxury` as the canonical domain. DNS should provide A records for the apex domain and a CNAME for `www` pointing to `lowkey.luxury` so both hosts resolve to the same site.
- Commit to the default branch and GitHub Pages will automatically publish the latest version.
